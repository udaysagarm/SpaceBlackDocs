## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2.  Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
3.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
