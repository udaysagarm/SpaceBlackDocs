# Introduction: The Philosophy of Space Black

> "We are drowning in chat interfaces. We need an agent that lives where we work."

## The Problem
Most AI agents today are trapped in browser tabs. To use them, you must context-switch away from your terminal and IDE. They can paste code snippets, but they can't *run* them. They can suggest fixes, but they can't *test* them.

## The Solution: Space Black
**Space Black** is an infrastructure designed to bring the AI agent **into your environment**. It is not a chat app; it is a **Terminal Operating System** for an autonomous entity.

By running locally:
1.  **Latency is zero** for UI interactions.
2.  **Privacy is respected**. Your files and keys never leave your machine (except to the LLM API).
3.  **Context is preserved**. The agent sees your file system, your git state, and your running processes.

## Meet Ghost
**Ghost** is the default agent inhabiting Space Black. Ghost is designed to be:
-   **Autonomous**: It doesn't just answer questions; it pursues goals.
-   **Persistent**: It remembers you across sessions.
-   **Evolving**: Its system prompt (`brain/SOUL.md`) is rewritten by the agent itself as it learns.

## Why "Space Black"?
The name reflects the environment: the deep, dark void of the terminal, where the most powerful work gets done. It is a minimalist, distraction-free void where you and Ghost build together.
